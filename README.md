# ðŸš— Teste PrÃ¡tico Splice

Desenvolvi esse site como parte do processo seletivo da empresa Splice, a partir da situaÃ§Ã£o apresentada abaixo:
I developed this simple website as a part of a job interview for Grupo Splice off of the following Utterance:

```sh
SituaÃ§Ã£o

Splice's OCC (Operational Control Center) is having trouble to identify fined vehicles and asked you to help them to ease this task. 

To do so, you have to develop a React.js web applcation, listing vehicle brands, containing filters and paginations so the OCC can, trough your code, find the vehicle brand they want. You'll have to develop a vehicle table and a simple form containing two inputs, one for the vehicle code and the other for the vehicle's name in order to register a new vehicle.


Requirements

- Listing the vehicles

- Pagination (with total vehicle count and current page index)

- Filters (brand name and code)

- New item register  (you must check if the vehicle brand or code was registered previously before registering a new one)

Obs. The data will be available in the following link: 

https://parallelum.com.br/fipe/api/v1/carros/marcas

You don't have to post new data to this API.

Boa sorte!
